					<p class="larger_intro">Medical drug and device companies use eClinical OS to help them bring new therapies to patients faster. Create a profile and search for clinical trials.</p>
 
<p>We're shifting the focus from technology to improving the human condition.  Our software is used by medical drug and device companies to organize and track results of important <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial" target="_blank">clinical research trials</a>, helping them improve the efficiency of bringing new therapies to market&mdash;improving quality of life for patients, and lowering the cost of healthcare.
	<br/><br/>
Volunteer patient participants make clinical research possible. If you're interested in learning more about clinical research, or about studies taking place in your area, or you want to make your contact information available to researchers, create an eClinical OS Patient Profile today.

<ul>
	<li>Create your own patient profile and search for clinical trials</li>
	<li>If you wish, make your information available in our volunteer directory, so researchers can contact you to discuss possible participation in clinical trials</li>
	<li>Track your own study progress online</li>
	<li>Stay engaged with your study, with insight into your visit schedule, upcoming appointments, and more</li>
	<li>Complete and submit your patient reported outcomes</li>
</ul>
