<p>We're shifting the focus from technology to improving the human condition. <a href="about.html">eClinical OS</a> is a best-in-class, full featured clinical trial platform. The <a href="marketplace.html">Marketplace</a> extends eClinical OS beyond comprehensive clinical trial features for Sponsors, CROs, and Sites, providing access to premium third-party service providers directly within the study workflow, and enabling the community that makes studies successful to collaborate in the cloud. 
<br/><br/>
When the clinical trial community&mdash;Sponsors, CROs, Sites, Patients, and Service Providers&mdash;connect in one place, in the cloud, the focus begins to shift, with studies achieving better results, faster, more efficiently, and at lower cost, to improve the human condition.
